# gdrive-folder-copier
Folder to folder copying of files on google drive. Supports subfolder and files 

# CURRENTLY COPYING DIRECTLY FROM FILES IS NOT SUPPORTED
For now, do it with the parent folder

Known issues:

  Doesn't work if script is not run for sometime, giving the error: bad request. Temporary fix is to delete creds.json from directory and reauthenticate. 
    Will appreciate pull requests
